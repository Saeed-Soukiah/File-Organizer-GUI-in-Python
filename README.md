# File-Organizer-GUI-in-Python

## Overview
File Organizer GUI is a minimalist Python application that automatically organizes files within a chosen directory. Using the Tkinter library, the tool recursively moves files into subfolders based on their file extensions. Conflicts are handled gracefully by automatically renaming files if necessaryâ€”making it the perfect solution for tidying up cluttered directories!

## Features
- **Recursive Organization:** Traverses through all subdirectories to organize files based on extension.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Automatically appends counters to filenames if duplicates are found.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple, intuitive GUI that requires just a few clicks.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with minor adjustments).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already.
- **Tkinter:** This standard library module is bundled with most Python installations. If you run into issues, verify your installation or consult your OS documentation.
